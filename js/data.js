They make wonderful gifts and great décor for your bar, man cave or outdoor living. We are proud to offer a beautiful alternative for bottles that just end up in landfills - especially a brand or bottle that may have sentimental meaning to you. All of our bottles are collected through the efforts of our friends, family and local businesses.

          title: "Jameson Irish Whiskey Bottle Candle",
          description: "This up-cycled eco-friendly candle is made from a reclaimed Jameson Irish Whisky bottle that was destined for the landfill. Our candles are made from earth friendly sustainable soy wax and lead-free all-cotton wicks. All of our fragrance oils comply with the strictest global RIFM and IFRA standards to ensure the utmost quality and safety. Please choose your desired scent (or un-scented) before checking out. Measurements: 7&quot; High x 3&quot; Diameter Weight: 2 lbs. 3 oz. (excludes shipping materials) Volume: 26 oz. soy wax Estimated burn time: 200+ hours Designed, hand-cut and poured in Alpharetta, GA USA. To get the best out of your candles we recommend the following: *Establish a “memory burn” - A memory burn is essentially a complete wet pool of melted wax. This wet pool will encompass the entire top portion of your candle (and be approximately 1/2 inch in depth). What the memory burn establishes is a guarantee that every time the candle is lit, it will retain the memory of a full melt pool. This will reduce tunneling and the excess of un-melted wax along the sides of the jar, leaving them clean. Another advantage to a memory burn is the hot scent throw. Ensuring a memory burn in your candles will allow every gram of scented wax to be used. *Trim the wick - It is important to keep your wick trimmed to 1/4 inch to ensure the proper burn, and keep the wick trimmings out of the melted wax. *Placement - Do not place your burning candle anywhere near fans or drafts. This will prevent your candle from burning properly and evenly, as well as possibly cause your wick to move and smoke as it burns. *Care: Little to no care should be needed but if some candle wax sticks to the inside of the glass you can use a hair dryer on the warm setting to even them up. Additionally, burning soy candles for two or more hours at a time ensures even melting along with trimming the wick to 1/4&quot; or less after each burn. *Re-purpose: We encourage you to continue enjoying your purchase long after your candle has expired. To remove any residual wax you can simply place the candle upside down on a cookie sheet lined with foil in your oven at its lowest setting (usually 165 degrees). After about 15 minutes you can carefully remove the remaining wax with a paper towel. CAREFUL - glass will be hot! If the glue that was used to secure the wick is still in place you can use a butter knife to gently dislodge it from the bottom of the bottle. Empty bottles make great pen/pencil holders or tea light candle containers. IMPORTANT: Please always remember to exercise caution when burning your candle and never leave unattended to avoid any possibility of fire or injury. *Please note: Burn times and measurements are approximate and may vary slightly. *We guarantee all of our products and want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason there is a problem with your order just let us know and we will make it right.",

Wax - We use a US produced natural soy wax with a soy based additive that reduces frosting and allows the wax to hold more fragrance than pure soy wax. Our wax has a higher melt point than regular soy wax which allows the candles to hold their shape better in warm weather and designed for optimal scent throw. Fragrance - Our fragrance are sourced from the largest distributor of unique, 100% concentrated fragrance oils in the USA. All of our fragrance oils comply with the strictest global RIFM and IFRA standards. Wicks - We use HTP coreless, all cotton braided wicks which are designed to bend at the tip when burning which forces the tip of the wick into the outermost portion of the flame where it burns hottest. The result is more complete combustion, leaving less carbon buildup (mushrooming) behind and less smoking. Containers - All of our bottles are sourced locally and reclaimed from businesses that would otherwise have to send them to the landfill. Sharing is caring.

Size: 8.5” x 3.5” x 3.5” **DURING CHECKOUT** Please leave your personalization request (name and birth year where applicable by design style) and preferred style in the Notes to Seller when you checkout. Processing takes 3-5 business days. Shipping time takes additional 2-9 business days. * &quot;Ship Next Business Day&quot; option will ship next business day, only for orders received before 5pm PST. Orders received after 5pm PST will ship the following business day. Orders placed after 5pm PST on Thursday or on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (before 5pm) will ship the following Monday.
